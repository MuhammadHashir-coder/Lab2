//Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

1. Ask the uset to enter a number "n"
2. Ask to give a number to divide "nth"
3. Set divisibility to (n%nth)
4. IF divisibility=0 
      Display "nth is divisor"
   else 
      Display "Not divisible"
5. SET eo=n%2
6.IF eo=0  //eo is even and odd
     Display "even"
  else 
     Display "odd"


//Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed.
